CTF Walkthrough Guide
1. Setup Instructions
Setup your virtual machine and network configuration.


2. Reconnaissance (Recon)
Perform Nmap scan to identify open ports and services.
Analyze the services running on the target machine.

netdiscover -r <10.10.10.0/24>

nmap -sV -v -Pn <10.10.10.7>
nmap -sC -A -p- -Pn <10.10.10.7>

Scan Results: bash

Service Info:

Hosts: 
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works

3. Enumeration
Enumerate services such as FTP, HTTP, SSH, etc.
Look for valuable files and potential weaknesses.

 - dirb http://10.10.10.6 -d /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt

- gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.6 -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 

dirb is more eficient but les organize but on this case gobuster les eficiente more organize and faster.

- wpscan --url http://10.10.10.14
with wpscan you can find vulnerability on wordpress

4. Vulnerability Identification
Identify potential vulnerabilities based on the reconnaissance and enumeration.
Search for public exploits, misconfigurations, or weak service versions.

- wpscan --url http://10.10.10.14

Service Info:

Wordpress Plugin Reflex Gallery 3.1.3 - Arbitrary File Upload 

http://10.10.10.6/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/

5. Exploitation
Exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to the system.
Use tools like Metasploit, Hydra, or custom scripts.




6. Privilege Escalation
Attempt to escalate privileges from a limited user to root.
Explore file permissions, configuration files, and environment variables.

No need


7. Post-Exploitation
Maintain access, collect additional flags, or prepare for further exploitation.
Investigate further vulnerabilities and opportunities for additional access.



8. Flag Collection
Locate and capture flags (usually text files or output from certain commands).
Flag collection might be in different formats (e.g., flag.txt or output from a successful command).


9. Conclusion
Summarize your successful exploitation.
Review any lessons learned or tools/techniques that were effective
