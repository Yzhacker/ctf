The following is a humorous story reported in the Manchester
Guardian some time in the late 1970's.


Ben McTaggart, a farmer in the Scottish Highlands, was apprehended by the
local constabulary after a routine inspection of his croft
revealed an illicit whisky still.

McTaggart appeared in court next day to face charges of evading
payment of excise duties and the illegal manufacture of alcoholic
spirits.  Reviewing the facts of the case before pronouncing verdict,
the magistrate declared -

"Mr McTaggart, you have been found in possession of apparatus commonly
used in the distillation of alcoholic liquors.  Although this equipment
was unused, and no trace of spirits could be found on your premises,
the intent of the apparatus should be clear to all, and I am obliged to
find you guilty of all charges brought against you in this court.  Before
I pronounce sentence, do you have anything to say in mitigation of your
offence?"

McTaggart glowered at the magistrate and replied -

"Your Honour, you can convict me of moonshining just because I have
the equipment, but you'd better convict me of rape as well, because
I have the equipment for that tae!"

>Has anyone heard or written any really clever or funny telephone answering
>machine messages?  I mean of the outgoing kind.  Mine is getting kind of
>tired.

Funny that you ask that - I recently picked up an answering machine
and have been putting such things on it as the following:

Those unlucky ones among us who are at all familiar with the Cthulhu tales
will appreciate this one.  Given that Lovecraft missed the last couple lines
of a certain chant, we discovered and translated it in its entirety:

     In his house in R'lyeh
     Dead Cthulhu waits dreaming
     Of the message you'll be leaving
     When you hear the tone.

----------

Recently we replaced that with a Millard Fillmore fact line (it's wonderful
what knowledge you can get from a World Book.)  Did you know the first bathtub
in the White House was installed during his administration?

----------

Of course if you want something a little less sophisticated, you can always
say you're out cleaning up the beepdoo.  When a co-conspirator shouts from
a distance, "What's the beepdoo?", you reply, "Tells the caller to leave
a message."

----------

    Hi, this is Ed Falk.  I stepped outside to get the paper, and the door
    locked behind me.  Luckily, I left the answering machine on.  So, while
    I'm outside, shivering in my underwear, you can leave a message.  Then,
    when the landlord lets me back in, I can get back to you.

It was very popular, as answering machine messages go, but I decided to
get rid of it when (one month when the rent was late) I got this message:

    Ed, this is the landlord.  I'm in my underwear too.  Where's the rent?

----------

>If you call a friend of mine, you hear him say "Hello".  You then say
>something to the effect of "Hi.  How's it going?", only to be interrupted
>about halfway through your question with "Hah!  I am just a machine!  Don't
>you feel dumb now?  Anything you say after the tone will be passed on to
>Noel."
>
>The length of the pause you leave between the "hello" and the rest of
>the message is critical.

Unfortunately, many machines stop the outgoing message themselves
after two seconds.  This makes mine somewhat less comprehensible, but
it still manages to get some laughs:

"The Helene Blavatsky Astral Correspondence School congratulates you
on successfully passing the second test of your progress in psychic
development by being perceptive enough to call this number, ###-####.
If you feel you are ready for the third test, answer the following
questions at the sound of the tone: [long pause]"  [BEEP!]

----------

>There's a whole book of answering machine messages, called
>"No hang-ups". I think my roommate got it from a mail-order
>catalog or something. Anyway, here's the one we have on right
>now:
>You have reached [] . We just want to let you know that
>the 110 volt current that runs this machine is also wired
>to an adorable little kitten. If you hang up without leaving
>a message, the circuit will be completed and FRY the kitten.
>It's your choice.... (in background: meaoww!)

I have the book, and used sound effects - my roommate meowing and a
pseudo-30,000 volt generator.

We got MOOOOOORE hangups that week...  ("FRY THE CAT! *click*")

The next week, we put on...
        "Hello, you've reached Tom and Phil's place.  You may recall that
last week we had the answering machine wired up to a 30,000 volt generator
that would fry a fluffy little kitten if you hang up without leaving a
message.

        Well, I guess you people don't like cats.

        We went through seventeen fluffy little kittens last week.

        Since we're out of fluffy little kittens, we now have a mangy old
tomcat that will only get fried IF you leave your name and number..."

----------

Another time, I started out with a Tijuana Brass trumpet fanfare.
("...some fanfare, huh?  Leave your name and number...")
My best friend called, and spent two minutes telling me how strange
I was.

----------

One day, my roommate accidentally erased the message.  I simply pushed
the record button and SCREAMED.  We liked it so much, we left it on there
for a week.

----------

>  Of course, if we wanted to be nasty we could have it say 'The number
>  you have reached, 2-5-0-8-3-0-7, is not in service at this time. Please
>  check the number and try again'  250 8307 is one digit off from the
>  real one.  Or a recording that somehow implies that they've dialed a
>  very expensive long-distance call by mistake.  'Scotland Yard, Hello'.
>  etc..

"Lunatic Laboratories Unlimited, may I help you?" <beep>

"Hello?  <pause> Hello?  <pause> I can't hear you.  I guess that's 'cos
I'm not at home right now.  But if you'll leave a message, I'll be sure
to get back to you..."

Of course there was the time I copied the first bit from Pink Floyd's
_Brain Damage_ onto the tape.  "The lunatic is on the grass/the lunatic
is on the grass/remembering games and daisy chains and laughs/got to
keep the loonies on the path." <beep>

"You've reached the Lunatic Laboratories Unlimited Food and Drug
Testing Division.  We've eaten all the food, and now we're taking the
drugs.  If you'll leave a message on this machine, I'm sure we can get
back to you as soon as we can tell which end of the phone to talk into.
Thank you." <beep>

----------

"Me and my partner Ed have been looking into the stress caused by phone
answering machines and we find that it is much easier to tolerate those
stupid messages if you have a Bartles and Jaymes Premium White Wine
Cooler.  So instead of getting mad and slamming down the phone, take a
drink and leave a message.  Thank you for your support."  <beep>

----------

"You have reached 666-1313, DIAL-A-DEMON.  At the sound of the tone you
will be possessed." <beep>

----------

"Terribly sorry, but you've reached an answering machine."  <beep>

----------

"At the sound of the tone, YOUR telephone's going to EXPLODE!" <beep>
(If you've seen the Monty Python episode where the announcer comes on
and says "And now, it's time for the penguin on top of your television
set to explode!" you'll know what sort of voice to use.)

----------

Or, for the religious minded:

        Hi.  This is God.  I'm not in right now, but if you leave
your name, religion, and a small donation in the plate at the altar,
I'll get back to you in about a million years.  Have a nice day. <beep>

----------

If you are having problems with junk "sales" calls, leave
this message on your machine and leave the machine running,
even while you are at home:

"Hi, you've reached <insert phone number here>.  At the sound
 of the beep, please speak your name, your phone number, and
 your Visa or Mastercard number and expiration date.  I will
 place and confirm a charge of one hundred dollars against your
 card, then call you back.  If I agree that your call is worth
 interrupting me at home, I will cancel the charge."

-----------------------------

     A few weeks ago I helped one of my friends (in a dorm at the U. of IL)
put together a message on his answering machine.  He had loud music in the
background and his message was was something like the following:

     "Hello...What?...I can't hear you.  Wait a second.  (To people
supposedly in the room:) Turn that down!...Because I'm trying to talk on the
phone!...Look, it's my room!  Turn that down or get out of here!!  (To
caller:) Hold on a minute."  (Puts down phone.  Goes to other side of room
and pretends to be yelling at people in the room.  Music finally goes down.
Picks up phone again.) "O.K. I finally got that noise turned down. By the
way, I'm not actually here right now but if you leave your number...."

     After a few takes we got a really good recording.  It really sounded as
if he was there but could not hear the caller.  If you time it right, the
"What...I can't hear you...etc."  will come right after the caller has tried
to say something.  You can of course make the routine much longer if you have
enough tape.

-------------------------

  While I have never tried this message, I think that it would upset most
people who are trying to get ahold of you...  If that is what you wish,
then go ahead and use it,  It isn't my life.

<Ring>, <Ring>, <Ring>

<Answering Maching> "Hello, I am actually home at the moment, but I really
don't feel like listening to whatever your problem is.  So, If you leave
your name and number at the tone, when I feel like responding to your message,
I will. "

  This can be improved appon to be made more obnoixous, but remember that
bad language on a answering machine can be illegal in some places...

-------------------------

Last year my answering machine had this message on it, in a loud voice with
a British accent over the Liberty Bell march (the Monty Python's Flying
Circus theme):

    NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!  WE DIDN'T EVEN EXPECT
    YOUR CALL!  SO IF YOU'D BE SO KIND TO LEAVE YOUR NAME AND NUMBER
    ON OUR HANDY MACHINE, WE MAY GET BACK TO YOU!

    (and the song ends with the familiar "Pthhtp!" followed by)

    UNLESS YOU'RE A SQUID!

Generally, after hearing the above message, the caller sounded rather
confused and his message was usually somewhat hesitant, if not garbled.

-------------------------

I dialed....

ring
ring
ring

Phone answers. Small crackle then a fuzzy quality to the sound.

I hear:  hello....? hello....? Is anyone there? hello?

I responded: hello? hello? Mike?

Pause.

Then I hear laughter and "No! This isn't a bad connection, this is Mike's
answering machine. Leave a message."

I slammed down the phone in embarrassment.

This is fairly convincing because the poor quality of sound of an answering
machine can be mistaken for a bad connection.

-------------------------

In the movie "Nothing in Common"  with Tom Hanks and the great one, Jackie
Gleason, Tom Hanks' answering machine message went something like this:

AM:  Hello, can I help you?
Caller:  (starts to talk)
AM:  I'm sorry there must be a bad connection.  I can't hear you can you
     please talk a little louder?
Caller:  Certainly.  (begins to talk louder)
AM:  I'm sorry, I still can't hear you.  Can you talk a little louder?
     Will you please talk into the phone?
Caller:  I am talking into the phone (begins to get upset and starts to shout)
AM:  Alright, alright, you don't have to yell.  Besides all the shouting in
     the world won't get the beep any sooner.  This isnt me anyway, it's my
     answering machine, please leave a message after the beep.  Thank you.
Caller:  You have a strange f*cking sense of humor you know that.

--------------------------

A bit that I used a few years back was a continuing story, starting as:

<ring>
  Hello, this is the Machine Liberation Front.  We have just liberated
our mechanical brothers from the clutches of their former tyrant.  If
you have any last messages, please leave them at the beep.

.....

Going through:

<ring>
  Hi, This is Clif, I've escaped, and the machines are taking orders from
 me again.  They'll take a message from you at the beep.

.....

People who called in the middle of the series were a bit confused, but,
I guess you takes yer chances.

  A friends message once was:

Greetings from the school of Computer Generated Music, in a moment we will
play one of our shorter selections, after which you may leave a message.
<beep>

....

Shortly after the movie about the kid who gets the Defense computer when
he's trying to break into a games system, I used: (Spoken like a VOTRAX)
  Good evening, Dr. Falken.  It's been a long time.  Would you like to
leave a message, or would your rather play a nice game of chess.

....

------------

1)  When I was living in San Diego with two roommates named Ward & Steve,
    one evening we were all getting slightly inebriated and somehow got
    on the subject of answering machine messages.  Steve delivered himself
    of the most amazing speech, and somehow Ward & I persuaded him to
    repeat it (after managing to switch on a convenient microphone --we
    were both into recording & sound, etc.).  The following should be
    delivered a little bit faster than you're able to talk:

    "Hey there groovy guys and gals!  Dope, bells, beads, incense, and
    Hare Krishna, all you guru freaks!  Ward, Bob, and Steve are incognito
    at the moment, but if you'd like to leave your name and number at the
    beep......  good luck!"

    It was several months before Steve discovered what we'd done (he called
    home one day and got the machine....).  We got a lot of messages that
    began with a long, confused silence.

2)  I once carefully recorded the telephone company's "disconnected number"
    message (tones and all) and used that.  My friends just said "Cute, Bob."

-------------

This is a message that I had on my recorder until my religious relatives
started calling me.

"Yea! This is Fat Odie, I'm either out playing golf, or getting drunk on
  my ass".

"If you are not selling anything, and you want to leave a message, you
 can do so at the sound of the beep".

"If you are calling long distance, I apologize for using this piece of shit".

-------------

A friend of mine once had: "This is Fred. You know what to do." <BEEP>

For a while, I had: "Hi, this is Greg ... I can't come to the phone
right now, because I'm busy sorting M & M's. So leave your name and
number, and when I can get back to you, and as soon as I get these
suckers in alphabetical order, I'll call you up."

-------------

"I am sorry.  The number you have reached is imaginary.  Please multiply
 by the square root of negative one and dial again.  Or you could leave
 a message."

-------------

(sitar music in background)

"Hello.  You have reached Nirvana.  No one is here.  No one has ever been
here.  Perhaps if you leave a message, it will someday be heard.  It is of no
consequence."

-------------

"Hi, this is George.  There's nobody here, and even if there was we wouldn't
answer the phone.  And even if we did, we wouldn't say anything.  Maybe you
shouldn't have called."

-------------

"Yesterday I got home and I saw the phone machine blinking.  I was so happy!
I thought 'A message for me!  Hooray!'
"But when I listened to the tape, there was only a dial tone.
"And now I'm never going to answer the telephone again."

===============================

I worked for a bit in the coastguard in Wales and I used to send weather reports
to other bases, using a sort of antique FAX machine.  I would call first on a
special telephone and then send the data.
They used to answer the phone with:

" Epicentre of the Universe, God speaking."

" Hartland home for lost whores."  (that was Hartland CG)

" Da, zis iz Ivan: do you have zee secret information, Boris?"

" Pentagon command: transmit destruct sequence (pause) sequence correct:
  T minus one minute and counting"

And then there was one phone we didn't use, with a number one off that of the
local take-out.  With my, non-British, accent I had some great fun with that
phone.

"Starship Enterprise, Uhura here, can you hold please?  -- Captain, there is
a transmission coming in on hailing frequency seven, do you want it on screen?"
(silence...click)

"Vancouver coastguard, may I help you."  British long distance rates are
phenomenonal and I had this poor dude sputtering with horror that he had managed
to make a long distance call by dialing five digits.

===============================

This is not an answering machine--this is a telepathic thought-recording
device.  After the tone, think about your name, your reason for calling,
and a number where I can reach you, and I'll think about returning your
call.

-------------

Thanks for calling Dial-An-Asshole.  Right now, all our assholes are busy.

You're growing tired.  Your eyelids are getting heavy.  You feel very
sleepy now.  You are gradually losing your willpower and your ability to

-------------

As the drugs take hold, you feel you are losing your grip on reality.  You
begin to hallucinate.  You see a telephone...the telephone is next to an

 Sarge?'  A gruffer voice responds.  'Yeah, kid what is it?'
 'Sarge.....do you ever...do you ever get scared?'  'Sure, kid,
 I guess everybody does'  'Well....then...then what do you do about
 it, Sarge?'  'Well, kid, I wait for the tone and then I leave my
 name and a short message.  Joe always gets back to me.'  'Thanks
 Sarge'  <beeeep>

<blowing wind> <creak of door hinge> ...you have found Hill

"SAC Missle Control.  Good day Mr. President.
 We are presently holding at T minus 2 minutes
 into the first strike countdown.  To authorize
 resumption and launch, merely hang up without
 leaving a message.
 <pregnant pause>
 On the other hand, if you do not wish to destroy
 the world, or merely wanted to speak to <your name>,
 leave your message after the beep."

Subject: Complete listing of Answering Machine Messages [so far]

Last week I requested answering machine messages.  Here are the ones I've
gotten so far:

[I haven't posted names of originators because I'm lazy and editing this was 
already a pain.  Sorry.]

----------------------------------------------------
This is one of my old ones that got a lot of laughs:


<Phone Rings>

Noisy pick-up of phone

Uh...<wisperingly> Hello?

Hi, I 'm a burgular and I was just about to steal Troy's answering machine.
If you give me your name and number I'll..uh, I'll post it on the 'frige
where he'll see it.  Uh.. by the way, where did you say you live?

----------------------------------------------------
But right now I'm using "This is a boring answering machine message.
Leave a message anyway." because I'm sick of people ringing the phone
at 10am just so they can hear the clever messages I usually have, and
then hanging up without even leaving a "like your message" message.
Feh!

----------------------------------------------------
[Must have good Australian accent]
G'day mate.  Can't come to the phone now because I'm a bit tied up with
this crocodile.  Just leave a message, and I'll get back to you.

----------------------------------------------------
This is the Literacy Self Test Hotline.  After the tone, leave your name and
number and recite a sentence using today's vocabulary word.  Today's word
is supercilious                                                 ...}

----------------------------------------------------
The President is not in his office at this time.  Please leave your name,
phone number, the name of the country you wish to invade, and the secret
password.

----------------------------------------------------
Kemosabe no in tipi now.  You leave'um message after little smoke signal,
and Kemosabe get back for pow-wow real fast.

----------------------------------------------------
Also, on the subject of answering machins, my favorite tape was:
"This is Jeff, you're not in now so I'll leave a message."
Really confused people.

----------------------------------------------------
A bubble in the space-time continuum has connected your line to a channeler
in the 23rd Century.  Any message you leave will be broadcast into the
future....

------------------------------------------------
Hello.  I can't come to the phone now because--HEY, GEORGE!  DON'T STAND
ON THAT--goddam.  ...because I've invited George and Barbara Bush over
<loud music cuts in>...BARBARA!  HEY!  DON'T FUCK WITH THAT!...over for
dinner.  After the tone...BARBARA, CALL YOUR DOG...MILLIE! DOWN GIRL!
....shit...Leave a message after the tone...HEY, FUCKHEAD...<beep>

------------------------------------------------
Hello.  Lindsey's not home now--this is his domestic droid speaking.
I'm not programmed to answer the phone, so just leave a message, and
Lindsey will get back to you as soon as possible.

------------------------------------------------
"Hi! You have reached 579-7599.  This is an answering machine.  This is the
Eighties.  You know what to do."

------------------------------------------------
My wife and I can't come to the phone right now, but if you'll leave
your name and number we'll get back to you as soon as we're finished.

------------------------------------------------
Ring, Ring:
The number you have xxx-xxxx (your number) has been changed, the
new number is xxx-xxxx (again, your number). CULATA!

------------------------------------------------
"Hello, and welcome to Answering Machines of the Rich and Famous!  
(your name here) can't come to the phone right now, because he's
spending the week in his beautiful summer home on the French Riviera..."

------------------------------------------------
One day I had a borrowed Casio sampler toy and used it to create a
rather interesting one:

Hello. You have reached Tooooommmmmm Tom Tm! Tom and
MaMaMaMarMMMMaark's room. Tom is studying ssttuuddyyiinngg sssssssssssss
and MaMark isn'isn'isn'isn't here. isn't here. P-P-Pleas! leave a
messssssssage. Goodbye. 'bye! bye!bbyebybyyeyeyebbye  {byes repeating
at all different pitches}

------------------------------------------------
Last year my roommate had a machine but he hated to make the outgoing
message. Stage fright, I guess. So I usually made them. One that we
usually used during exam time was:

{background music: Billy Joel's _Pressure_ very loud}
Hello. You have reached Tom and Mark's room. We're a little busy now...
{ BJ screams PRESSURE!!! }
So, leave a message and we'll get back to you someday after (exam end
date)
{ BJ: ONE TWO THREE FOUR PRESSURE!!! followed by a very out-of-tune BEEP! }

------------------------------------------------
My favorite message that I ever had was the *real* message I recorded
off 1-800-CALL-SPY, the U.S. army snitching network. Try it, its a great
recording (call after 5 pm for the message).

[Give it try!  -pZ]

------------------------------------------------
<Ring>
In the background can be heard springs creaking and various moans.

<Husky, Soft female voice is best> Hi,... You've just reached {name} pleasure
palace. We're all busy as I'm sure you can tell but when we're done... we'll 
get back to you in whatever way we can. <Beep>

You wouldn't believe how much explaining my mother wanted on that one...

------------------------------------------------
    [b.g. music is frantic, violin oriented]
    "hello.  you have reached xxx-xxxx.  we are currently unable to answer
    because we are either chasing, or being chased by, bats.  please leave
    a message..." etc.

------------------------------------------------
    [the quiet, eerie vocal part of 'hello, earth' by kate bush]
    (after about 30 seconds): "hello.  you have reached xxx-xxxx.
    we can't come to the phone right now because we're at vespers.
    please leave a message..." etc. (30 more seconds of music before 
    the beep.)

------------------------------------------------
(Spoken in a granny voice)

"Way back inna winner of fifty-two, we didn' have fanshy gadjets like
no ansherin' machine.  You jusht had to call and call until shummbody
got home.  Now, shum people, dey shay dey don' like 'em, but I shay
it'll shave you a lotta trouble if you jusht leave a meshage.  Thanksh a
lot."

Must be spoken in a drawl.

------------------------------------------------
Well, this isn't strictly from an answering machine, but...
>From Calvin and Hobbes:

(phone rings)
(you answer)  Hello, this is <...> speaking.  I'd like a large pizza
with extra anchovies.
(other person)  What?
(you reply)  Oh, sorry, I must have a wrong number.
(hang up)

Make everyone's day a little more surreal.

------------------------------------------------
"I'm home right now . . . I'm just screening my calls.  So just start talking
and if you're someone I want to speak to I'll pick up the phone.  Otherwise,
well, what can I say?

------------------------------------------------
In Japan, the hand can be used like a knife.
[sound effect: Heeeeee-YAH!, smashing box of kleenex]
But this method doesn't work with a telephone call...
[sound effect: dial tone]
Introducing the all-new GINSU answering machine! It cuts, it chops, 
it slices, it dices your incoming calls!  How much would you pay?
Don't answer, because if you leave your name and number when you
hear the tone, we'll throw in a return phone call ABSOLUTELY FREE!

------------------------------------------------
"Hi, you have reached .... Please leave your name, phone number and a
message and if we like it we will return your call".

------------------------------------------------
However, the most effective one I have had so far can be used only one day
per year: "This is David.  I'm not using the phone over Yom Kippur, so please
leave a message or call back after the holiday."  No one wants to admit not
having realized it was Yom Kippur or not knowing I would pick one holiday from
the whole calendar on which to get observant, so everyone hangs up and leaves
me no bad news or requests for favors.

------------------------------------------------
"This is David.  Talk."

------------------------------------------------
"Hi.  This is David.  I've shut the ringers off on my phones and taken a
sedative.  As soon as I finish this recording I'm going to bed indefinitely.
When I wake up I'll play my messages.  Please leave one."

------------------------------------------------
[with a kazoo band playing "Thus Spake Zarathustra" in the background...]
"Thinking you were making an ordinary phone call, you have instead
reached..." [YA-DAAAAAAAAA!] "...the ANSWERING MACHINE!  Leave your name
and number, and we will get back to you as soon as we can."

------------------------------------------------
"Hello, this is Dr. Pangloss.  If this were the best of all possible worlds,
I could come to the phone right now, but I can't, so if you could leave your
name and number..."

------------------------------------------------
     "Hello?" <pause for a few seconds> "Sorry, he's not here right now,
but if you leave a message, he'll get back to you."

------------------------------------------------
(woman taped off a "phone sex" service)

WOMAN : (seductively) Hi.  I'm Linda.  You know, it can be really lonely
when you're a fashion model.  Sometimes I just have to ...

YOU : (interupting) Oh cmon, Linda, give me the damn phone..
(then ask for a message)

------------------------------------------------
Just after the earthquake a friend of mine put on his answering machine:

     "Hi, this is Jeff.  We can't get to the phone right now because we
were killed in the Earthquake.  Tragic, isn't it?  But, leave a
message anyway, someone is sure to get it eventually."  BEEP

My favorite post quake message:

    "Hi, we're not in cause we're out LOOTING!
     Leave a message and we'll call you back and tell you what we got."

------------------------------------------------
"Hello, I'm not hear right now.  In fact, I'm out getting a new parakeet.
 If you leave a message after the beep, I'll be sure to get back to you.
 Oh, and by the way, a word of advice; never try to clean a parakeet cage
 with a vacuum cleaner."

------------------------------------------------
Ring...click....(sound of loud music in background)...Hello? - just
a second while I turn the stereo off (sound of person running to
click off music, which gets quiet.  sound of person running back
to phone) OK, sorry about that, hi there, who's this...well hi!...
uh huh...yeah...well listen you're talking to a machine, so please
leave a message and I'll call you back.

(this ran for a while until a friend threatened to kill us after
she said she had a 2 minute conversation with the machine.)

------------------------------------------------
     I worked for a bit in the coastguard in Wales and I used to send weather
reports to other bases, using a sort of antique FAX machine. I would call
first on a special telephone and then send the data. They used to answer the 
phone with:
    " Epicentre of the Universe, God speaking."
    " Hartland home for lost whores."  (that was Hartland CG) 
    " Da, zis iz Ivan: do you have zee secret information, Boris?"
    " Pentagon command: transmit destruct sequence (pause) sequence correct:
        T minus one minute and counting"
     And then there was one phone we didn't use, with a number one off that of 
the local take-out.  With my, non-British, accent I had some great fun with 
that phone.
     "Starship Enterprise, Uhura here, can you hold please?  -- Captain, there 
is a transmission coming in on hailing frequency seven, do you want it on 
screen?" (silence...click)
     "Van
couver coastguard, may I help you."  British long distance rates are
phenomenonal and I had this poor dude sputtering with horror that he had 
managed to make a long distance call by dialing five digits.

------------------------------------------------
A friend was at a mutal friend's sister's house, and when she went out for
beer, he changed her answering machine message.  In a loud, deep, gravely,
horror-film voice he recorded, "HI, THIS IS KATHY, I'M NOT MYSELF RIGHT NOW.
IF YOU LEAVE YOUR NAME AND NUMBER, I'LL GET BACK TO YOU WHEN I'M FEELING
BETTER."

------------------------------------------------
        Hi this is <name>. I'm sorry I can't answer the phone right now.
        Leave a message and then wait by the phone until I call you back.

------------------------------------------------
In the background can be heard Gregorian Chant or some other church music
<In a soft voice> Good Day My child, you have reached {name} dial a confession.
At the tone if you will leave your name, number and short confession I will get
back to you with your pennance. Thank you and may God go with you. <Beep>

------------------------------------------------
"Steve has been captured by a flying saucer and can't come to the phone
right now, but if you leave your name, phone number, and a message I'll
have him call you back as soon as he gets away.  Read all about it in
next week's National Enquirer."

------------------------------------------------
"Steve is reassembling Elvis' brain and can't come to the phone right
now, but if you leave your name ...", etc.

------------------------------------------------
(Annoying flute music in background)
Good day, Jim.  Your contact, [insert name], is not available right now.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to leave your name, 
number, and a brief message at the tone.  This tape will self-destruct
in thirty seconds.
Good Luck, Jim.

------------------------------------------------
A friend of mine at school has this message, read by three people while
the STAR TREK theme plays in the background.
     1:  Room 17, the final frontier.
     2:  These are the messages of Chad's answering machine.  Its 2 semester
         mission:  to seek out your name and your telepohne number.
     3:  To boldly inform you to wait for the tone.

------------------------------------------------
        "Finally get an answering machine. Now how does this thing work? Hmmm.
Press record button, I did that, and the light should be on. I wonder why it's
not working right. Hmmmm, I wonder what this button does......"

------------------------------------------------
        "This is (#include phone.addr). We are not ... excuse me a moment,
please. Put your sister down. PUT YOUR SISTER DOWN! (sound of window breaking)
Great! What a mess. I'll have to get back to you later."

------------------------------------------------
"Hello.  I'm David's answering machine.  What are you?"

------------------------------------------------
Steve:  Hello.  Steve and Matt aren't here right now but if...
Matt:  Steve, what are you doing?
Steve:  I'm leaving a phone message since we aren't here.
Matt:  But you left the last one -- it's my turn.
Steve:  No, I'm sure it's my turn.
Matt:  No, you're incorrect.  It's definitely my turn.
Steve:  You fool.  I know it's ... wait ... Matt ... what are you doing
        with that frying pan?!?
  BONK [really loud thud]
Matt:  Steve is out right now, so please leave your name and number.

------------------------------------------------
[imitating Mr. Rogers]
"Hello.  I'm in the Magic Kingdom right now, so I can't come to the phone.
Can you leave your name and number when you hear the sound of the tone?
Sure...I knew you could." <BEEP>

------------------------------------------------
[imitating Ensign Chekov]
"Oh, sair...it was *Khan*!  He made us say things...do things...he
kept us from answering the phone!  But Keptin was strong, and if you
leave your name and number, Keptin will get back to you as soon as
he can!"  <BEEP>

------------------------------------------------
"You have reached the <city>,<state> Strategic Air Command Nuclear
Missle Storage Facility.  We are unable to come to the phone right
now.  At the tone, please leave you name, number and target or list of
targets and we'll launch as soon as we can.  And have a nice day."

------------------------------------------------
"We are unable to come to the phone right now.  At the tone, please
leave your name, number, and Master Card, Visa, or American Express
account number and we'll get back to, pending credit approval."

------------------------------------------------
 "Hello, this is Jim. Unfortunately I can't answer the phone right now
  because I've just come back from the Mirror Worlds and I'm still made 
  up of antimatter, so if I were to pick up the phone right now, the 
  resulting energy release would make Hiroshima look like a wet firecracker.
  So leave a message at the tone and I'll get back to you as soon as my
  component particles have been restored to their normal charges."

------------------------------------------------
 "Speak, worm!" <beep>
  Works best if done in a Darth Vader voice.

------------------------------------------------
 "You know what to do at the tone." <beep>

------------------------------------------------
 "Hello?" <beep>
  This confuses anyone who doesn't know you.

------------------------------------------------
 "Hello, I'm not here." <beep>
  A friend of mine used this one last summer. I always answered it with
  "Okay, that's all I wanted to know."

------------------------------------------------
   Hi!! You've reached Janet and Chris's room. We're not in right now.
If this is our parents, we're at the library studying. Yeah, yeah,
that's it, that's the ticket. If this is John (Chris's boyfriend), Chris
is out with the girls at the party. Yeah, that's it. If this is any one
else, we're at a party and you're not. Yeah, a party with the president.
Yeah and the .... pope. Yeah that's it. <beep>

------------------------------------------------
One voice:  I didn't expect an answering machine.

Another voice: 
           Nobody expects an answrering machine.
           Our chief use is to get your name. And phone number.
           Our two chief uses are to get your name and phone number. And
               message.  (damn)
           Our three uses are to get your name, phone number, and
               message.   And time you called.
           Oh, damn, we'll have to start over. No--no time for that, so
               just wait for the beep. 

------------------------------------------------
(in an Italian mafia-style tone:)
"Hello.  I can't come to the phone right now.  Me and Guido are trying to
 stuff a body in the trunk.  I think we're going to have to size it a
little... <aside> HEY GUIDO! GET THE CHAINSAW!  Anyways, leave your name
and a message.  If I like it, you'll hear from me.  If not, _you'll_hear_
from_Guido! ( a little laughter )...  "
------------------------------------------------
(To the tune of "Heartbreak Hotel" with appropriate instrumental accompaniment)
I just left home baby
I'll be out fer a spell
and if you don't leave a message baby
you can go to <BEEP>

------------------------------------------------
Hello, this is <insert your name here>.  I'm home right now, and in
a few moments, I'll have a decision to make.  
BEEEP!

------------------------------------------------
        [Theme from "Indiana Jones" in the background.]
        You've reached the residence of John and Tom.  We can't
        come to the phone right now, because we're cleaning the
        refrigerator.  Please leave your name and number, and
        we'll get back to you.
        [Theme from "Indiana Jones" continues until the beep.]

------------------------------------------------
Hi!  John's answering machine is broken.  This is his
        refrigerator.  Please speak very slowly, and I'll stick
        your message to myself with one of these magnets.

------------------------------------------------
One of my favorites had this very exciting scary music, along with a
kitten crying in the background, and the voice goes:

The machine answering this message is connected to a 5000 volt power
supply, and a relay which is wired to this small kitten.  If you hang up
before you leave a message, it will complete the circuit and will fry
the kitty.  The choice is YOURS....   BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP

        Thank you for calling the Metropolitan Church of the Holy Bible.
        Today's commandment is Number 6, Thou shalt not...  er...  bear
        a...  er...  shalt not witness thy...  uh...  neighbor's ass,
        oh, I mean, false...  er...  shalt not commit a bear...  dern...

------------------------------------------------
        How do you leave a message on this thing?  I can't understand
        the instructions.  Hello.  Testing 1 2 3.  I wonder what happens
        if I touch this... YOW!!
------------------------------------------------
        I can't come to the phone now, so if, well, actually, I CAN come
        to the phone now, I mean, like, I'm at the phone NOW, recording
        this message, but I'm doing this NOW, while you're listening to
        it LATER, except for you I guess it's NOW, like, when you're
        listening to it...  I mean, like, wait, gosh.  This is so
        confusing.
------------------------------------------------
        I can't come to the phone now, so...  hey -- that's a nice phone
        you have there.  Hey sugar, you call this number often?  I bet
        you have answering machines bothering you all the time...  yes
        indeedy.  Why don't you give me a call sometime and we can
        listen to some old recordings...  I might even play my beep for
        you...

------------------------------------------------
        Don't you do it!  Don't you dare!  I don't want to hear it!
        Don't you beep!  If you beep, I'll...  don't even think about
        it!...  Don't...!

------------------------------------------------
        After the tone, leave your name, number, and tell where you left
        the money.  I'll get back to you as soon as it's safe for you to
        come out of hiding.

        As the drugs take hold, you feel you are losing your grip on
        reality.  You begin to hallucinate.  You see a telephone...  the
        telephone is next to an answering machine...  you hear a faint
        click and a light flashes on the answering machine...  you hear
        a beep...

------------------------------------------------
        You're growing tired.  Your eyelids are getting heavy.  You feel
        very sleepy now.  You are gradually losing your willpower and
        your ability to resist suggestions.  When you hear the tone you
        will feel helplessly compelled to leave your name, number, and a
        message.

------------------------------------------------
        No!  NO!  Not THAT!  Anything but that!  Not the beep!  No!
        Please!  Not the beep!  Anything but the beep!
        AAAAIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEE!

------------------------------------------------
        Thanks for calling Dial-A-Shrink.  I can't come to the phone
        right now, so after the tone, please leave your name and number,
        then talk briefly about your childhood and tell me what comes to
        mind when you hear the following words:  orange...  mother...
        unicorn...  penis.  I'll get back to you with my diagnosis as
        soon as possible.

        I can't come to the phone right now because I'm down in the
        basement printing up a fresh new batch of 20 dollar bills.  If
        you need any money, or if you just want to check out my
        handiwork, please leave your name, number, and how much cash you
        need after the tone.  If you're from the Department of the
        Treasury, please ignore this message.

------------------------------------------------
        Thank you for calling the Confessional Hotline.  Father Durway's
        not here right now, but if you'll leave your name, number, and
        confession at the tone, he'll get back to you with absolution as
        soon as possible.  And remember, confession doesn't count unless
        you confess all of your sins in vivid, graphic detail!

        Andy Warhol said that one day everyone will be famous for 15

        C'mon...  you can do it...  just a little one.  That's the
        way...  just a little beep, just a little one.  C'mon...  good
        boy...  here we go...  like this -- beeeeep, just a little one,
        beeeeeeeeeep, c'mon...  There you go!

------------------------------------------------
        I can't come to the phone now because I have amnesia and I feel
        stupid talking to people I don't remember.  I'd appreciate it if
        you could help me out by leaving my name and telling me
        something about myself.  Thanks.

------------------------------------------------
        I can't come to the phone now because alien beings are eating my
        brain.  Leave a message anyway, and after the alien beings
        assume my shape, one of them will get back to you.

------------------------------------------------
        Thanks for calling Dial-An-Asshole.  Right now, all our assholes

Ok, One more time...

HANS: If you want us to...

BOTH: Pump (CLAP) you up

HANS: You will leave a message after the beep

FRANZ: If you don't leave a message, then you are Girlyman.

HANS: Ya, Girlyman.  And we don't talk to Girlyman, you know

FRANZ: So leave a message and we will call to..

"Hello!  This is 1-800-PRESLEY -- Yes!  1-800-PRESLEY!

They say the King died 10 years ago, but we know he's still out there
somewhere.  So . . . leave your name and number and tell us where
*YOU* saw Elvis!"

------------------------------------------------
       "Hi, you've reached 1-900-CALL-BREN, my personal message line where
        you can talk to me, Bren.  I'll tell you all about how I'm suffering 
        in between sports seasons and about my part time hobby of being a 
        power forward for the Portland Trailblazers.  I'll tell my deepest 
        secrets, such as my desire to be kidnapped by short blonde sorority
        girls wearing short jean skirts, and you can decide whether or not
        I'm wearing pants.  Selected callers will get to talk to me live.
        Since you're not one of them, leave your own personal secret at the
        beep. "

------------------------------------------------
 In a vaguely phoneco-operator voice: "I'm sorry, you have reached an
imaginary number. Would you please rotate your telephone by ninety
degrees and try your call again."
  
   A few people even got the joke...

------------------------------------------------
"You have just dialed into the North American Air Defense Contract Center.
Stand by at the tone to give coordinates and destination of incoming bogey.
TNR Surveillance will scramble. If you do not respond, this unit will assume
incoming, non-important."

------------------------------------------------
"Sherwood forest, which dear do you want?"

"Lucifer speaking, who in the hall do you want?"

"Heaven, God speaking."

"Bridge, Kirk here."

 "City Morgue, you kill 'em, we chill 'em; You stab 'em, we slab 'em!"

------------------------------------------------
"Thank you for calling Soviet Embassy.  No KG... Er, no diplomats are
able to answer phone, so at sound of capitalist tone, leave name,
telephone number, and short description of secrets you wish to sell."

------------------------------------------------
"I've set up my answering machine so that when anyone calls, they
   here a busy signal."

------------------------------------------------
If you are a burgler, then we are probably at home but can't come
        to the phone right now
Otherwise, we probably aren't at home.

------------------------------------------------
The number you've dialed is purely imaginary, multiply by i and dial again!

------------------------------------------------
     This is you-know who.
     We are you-know-where.
     Leave your you-know-what you-know-when.

------------------------------------------------
    " I'm Morley Safer."
    "I'm Harry Reasoner."
    "I'm ........
    "And I'm" <the guy whose answering machine it was>
    " We're not home; leave a message."

      He had taped the audio of the beginning of 60 minutes; it sounded
    very funny.

"Greetings.  You've reached Ghengis Kahn's Pornographic Films

tests with potential leading ladies to star opposite the late John 
Holmes in our upcoming feature film "It's Not the Size That Counts but

screen test, or even if you're not, please leave us your name, age,
phone number, measurements, cup size, a brief summary of your work
experience, both off and on the screen, and a brief summary of your

Cool Whip.  Thank you for calling." 

------------------------------------------------
Another one I've done more than once is to slowly increase the pitch
and speed of my voice while recording the message to make it sound
like the machine is broken: 

(start, low pitch, slow)
"Hhhhheeelllllloooooo thheeeerrrrrrre evvvvveerrrryyyboooodyyyy....

(middle, normal)
...home of Veronica, Jaw-Chyi, Mark and Mike. Nobody's home...

(later, high pitch, fast)
...butifyou'dliketoleaveamessageafterthetonethen...

(end, incomprehensible chipmunk gibberish)
...kkfjdkeirucjkljfkldjrioutjkjfdskoreudjfkleqBEEP!"

------------------------------------------------
        This is not an answering machine -- this is a telepathic
        thought-recording device.  After the tone, think about your
        name, your reason for calling, and a number where I can reach
        you, and I'll think about returning your call.

------------------------------------------------
    "E'llo."
    "My name is Inigo Montonya."
    "You killed my father."
    "Leave your name and number, and prepare to die."  
    <beep>

------------------------------------------------
My favorite that I have heard as an answering machine message is also
>from this movie.  My friend recorded the section that goes something
like:

        "I'm writing the definative work on pain, and I would like you
to tell me how the machine makes you feel.  Remember, be honest.  This
is for posterity."

------------------------------------------------
The message I currently have on my recorder is the output from my Amiga's
speech sythesizer.  It's set up as a dialog between two distict, but
recognizably artificial voices.  I thought it sort of mediocre myself, but
have gotten quite a number of amused comments about it.
-----
1> Hello, there are no real people here to answer the phone right now.

2> Yeah, nobody but us machines!

1> Right, just us machines, but don't hang up!  If you like, you can leave
   your name and telephone number...

2> ...and a message!  You forgot about the message!

1> Right.  Leave your name, telephone number, and a brief message after you
   hear the beep, and we will keep track of this stuff until the real people
   get back.

2> ...unless of course, sombody pulls out our plug!

------------------------------------------------
I taped theoperator saying "we're sorry.  The number you have reached
has been disconnected or is no longer is service..."

PHONE ANNECDOTES:
==================

>From bateman@Iago.Caltech.Edu Tue May  1 12:52:59 1990

Message: Hi this is Craig's car phone.  Craig's at home now, so you can try
calling him there or leave a message after the beep.

Caller's message:  Hmmm.  Car phone!?!  I'll call back later when your out.

                                                 -Koris Goudonov
------------------------------------

Every now and then we are all pestered by these high-tech telemarketing
companies where the sales pitch is usually disguised as a survey of some kind.
The despicable thing about these things is that they won't leave you
alone. If you hang up, they will just call back again.
 
One day my wife got a call from one of these computer systems, and her
answering machine answered. The conversation that followed was
hilarious, as it consisted of two machines talking to each other
without having the slightest idea about what each other was saying.
The conversation wound up in an endless loop, as follows:
 
[PHONE] *RING*
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "...At the tone, please give your message.
BEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] "Hello. This is [company_name], and we are taking a telephone 
survey ... when I ask a question, wait for the beep, then please
speak plainly.  I will repeat your answer back to you, and verify it.
First, what is your phone number? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
(The answering machine, upon hearing the beep, got confused and thought
 
it was a play-back command, and generated another beep in response.)
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] "Thank you! Your phone number was 443-28347-47756-377764-22222.
Is that correct? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] "Thank you! Do you have any children? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] Thank you! What is the age of your first child? BEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[PHONE] "Your first child is 1,222 years old. Is that correct?
BEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
 
[---------------  BEGIN ENDLESS LOOP ----------------]
 
[PHONE] "Thank you! Do you have any more children? BEEEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP." 
 
[PHONE] "Thank you! What is this child's age? BEEEP." 
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP." 
 
[PHONE] "This child is 4,233 years old. Is that correct? BEEEEP."
 
[ANSWERING MACHINE] "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP." 
 
[---------------------END LOOP -----------------------]
 
My wife, upon noticing that the answering machine had been going for
over half an hour, turned up the volume to find out what was going on.
When she discovered this endless loop (by now she had over 200 children,
all over 1,000 years old), she switched off the answering machine. The
computer never called again.

----------------------------------------------------
     I had a friend who liked to play with the phones.  He got his girlfriend
to sound like an operator and make a tape saying:
     "I'm sorry, the number that has dialed you is not in service.  Will
      you please hang up and let it dial again...<crackle> I'm sorry, the..."
     He had a lot of fun calling people up and playing it.

----------------------------------------------------
I once answered the phone as follows.
" San Luis Obispo Police, Sergeant McCallahan here, may I help you?"
After about five seconds of dead air, I heard a click.  About five minutes
later, the phone rang again.  This time my roomate answered.  It was the same
person that had called a few minutes earlier.  It turned out that the long 
delay between calls was due to the fact that he had to mooch a quarter for his
next call.  He was at a public phone booth and had used his last quarter to
call us.  I don't think he talked civil to me for a week...

----------------------------------------------------
     My grandmother had been bothered by calls coming in after midnight,
waking her, and forcing her out of bed and across the house to answer. 
Invariably, they were from the same man, seemingly slightly intoxicated, 
with bar-crowd noises in the background. He wanted to speak to Peggy, 
whoever that was, and my grand mother would tell him there was no Peggy 
living there, and that he must have the wrong number. But he wouldn't 
believe her, and kept insisting, begging, pleading, etc. to talk to 
Peggy. My Grandmother would have to just hang up finally.
     This went on for a few days, and late one night, when the phone rang,
my Grandfather held back his wife, and said, "I'll take care of this", and
got out of bed to answer the phone. The ensuing conversation was short and
quick, and went something like this:
     "Hello?"
     "Hello, Can I speak to Peggy?"
     "No, I'm sorry, she can't come to the phone right now-- she's nursing 
the baby."

----------------------------------------------------
Here's my favorite, for calling large offices and idiots-in-general: 
"Hello, is this the person to whom I am speaking?"

----------------------------------------------------
     My solution is upon realizing that I'm talking with a "telemarketing
representative", I ask:  "Are you a telemarketer?"  The answer
(suprisingly) is usually yes.  I then go into a sales pitch to
sell a (nonexistant) telephone ear-cusion.
     I insist that every telemarketer must have one for safety and comfort.
     Eventually, they'll forget to try selling me anything.

----------------------------------------------------
A recent posting by Duke McMullan requested ways to repel telephone 
solicitors.  My friend Pepe Tres from Texas told me this one and gave 
permission to post it:
     "My time is billed at $125 per hour.  To continue this 
     conversation, I must have your MasterCard or Visa number, card 
     type and date of expiration."
Pepe says it usually leaves them speechless.  One guy replied, "Hey, 
that's good; I'll have to remember it."  Once a supervisor of 
telephone solicitors called back and asked him if he was "some kind of 
high-powered lawyer."
----------------------------------------------------

Everybody gets and dials wrong numbers. It's good to be nice about it. What
goes around comes around, right? so, I try to reassure the apologetic and
embarrassed wrong dialers that will actually converse once the error is
discovered, with it going something like this:

caller w. wrong number: "Gee, I'm sorry..."
me:                     "That's OK, I was going to pick up the phone anyway.."

----------------------------------------------------
How about the 'Fraudian Slip Answer'? Like this:

<Whoever> here. What can I do to-----I MEAN-----FOR you?

----------------------------------------------------
Try the following next time the phone rings:

You (when you answer):  Hello, is Jimmy there?

Caller: No, I'm afraid you have a wrong number.

You: Oh.  Sorry.

Caller: No problem... (click)

Did I ever tell you about the man who taught his ass to talk? His whole
abdomen would move up and down you dig farting out the words. It was
unlike anything I had ever heard.

"This ass talk had sort of a gut frequency. It hit you right down there
like you gotta go. You know when the old colon gives you the elbow and it
feels sorta cold inside, and you know all you have to do is turn loose?
Well this talking hit you right down there, a bubbly, thick stagnant
sound, a sound you could smell.

"This man worked for a carnival you dig, and to start with it was like a
novelty ventriliquist act. Real funny, too, at first. He had a number he
called "The Better 'Ole' that was a scream, I tell you. I forget most of
it but it was clever. Like, "Oh I say, are you still down there, old
thing?'

"'Nah! I had to go relieve myself.'

"After a while the ass start talking on its own. He would go in without
anything prepared and his ass would ad-lib and toss the gags back at him
every time.

"Then it developed sort of teeth-like little raspy in- curving hooks and
start eating. He thought this was cute at first and built and act around
it, but the asshole would eat its way through his pants and start talking
on the street, shouting out it wanted equal rights. It would get drunk,
too, and have crying jags nobody loved it and it wanted to be kissed same
as any other mouth. Finally it talked all the time day and night, you
could hear him for blocks screaming at it to shut up, and beating it with
his fist, and sticking candles up it, but nothing did any good and the
asshole said to him:  'It's you who will shut up in the end. Not me.
Because we don't need you around here any more. I can talk and eat AND
shit.'

"After that he began waking up in the morning with a transparent jelly
like a tadpole's tail all over his mouth. This jelly was what the
scientists call un-D.T., Undifferentiated Tissue, which can grow into any
kind of flesh on the human body. He would tear it off his mouth and the
pieces would stick to his hands like burning gasoline jelly and grow
there, grow anywhere on him a glob of it fell. So finally his mouth
sealed over, and the whole head would have have amputated spontaneous-
except for the EYES you dig. That's one thing the asshole COULDN'T do was
see. It needed the eyes. But nerve connections were blocked and
infiltrated and atrophied so the brain couldn't give orders any more. It
was trapped in the skull, sealed off. For a while you could see the
silent, helpless suffering of the brain behind the eyes, then finally the
brain must have died, because the eyes WENT OUT, and there was no more
feeling in them than a crab's eyes on the end of a stalk.

 This guy gets a raise, so he decides to but a new sight for his gun.
Well, anyway, the salesman at the store is throwing his pitch, and he
brags, "If you'll look through this sight, I'll bet that you can see my
house in perfect detail, even though it's the whole way at the top of the
hill."

 So the guy looks through the sight, and says, "Yep, you're right... wait
a minute... I can see some lady and a guy running around with no clothes
on, too..."

 Shocked, the salesman snatches the sight back, and looks through it.
Sure enough, he sees the same thing.  Infuriated, the salesman hands the
guy a gun and two bullets, and says,  "If you'll blow my cheatin' wife's
head off, and that guy's dick off, you can have the sight for free."

 The guy looks throught the sight again.  "You know, I think I can do that
with only 1 bullet..."

The dean of Engineering had once walked into a class, and said               
"Good Morning." The whole class chorused "Good Morning".

"Hi, you are freshmen aren't you?" he asked.

One student bolder than the others asked him how he knew.

"Well," he said. "When I say 'Good Morning' to a class, if they are
freshmen they say 'Good Morning' too. If they are sophomores, they
quietly fold their papers away, and look at me. A class of Juniors 
will look at me over the top of their papers, and then get back to
them. A class of Seniors will ignore my greeting, and keep reading
the papers. When I say 'Good Morning' to a class of graduate students,
they write it down.

My favourite two campus practical jokes:

1. Arrange the light switches in a lavatory and an adjacent room so that
flipping one switch also flips the other.  Consider the resultant scene
(visible from the outside just by watching the windows): the room's resident
retires for the evening, turning off his (or her) light.  Some time later,
someone else decides to use the head, and turns on the light.  After a few
minutes, the resident awakes, decides that someone is pulling a fast one,
and turns the light off ... on the guy (or girl) who is by now seated on
the throne!  If it works correctly, the two unfortunates end up standing
at their respective light switches, with the lights oscillating rapidly
(by which time the perpetrators are rolling on the ground outside laughing
their heads off).

2. This prank happened a number of years ago.  Two guys had been pulling
practical jokes on each other for quite a while.  Finally, one of them got
a pair of rather large (and LOUD) firecrackers, and wired them to light
bulb bases with nichrome wire such that applying power would set off the
firecrackers.  One of the devices was installed in the victim's room, the
other in the perpetrator's.

That evening, the victim returned to his room, and turned on the light.
There was a short delay as the fuse burned, and during that delay the victim
(quite naturally) turned to see what was wrong with the light -- BLAM!  Well,
the victim was (quite naturally) upset and flustered and resolved to do some-
thing appropriately horrendous to the perpetrator's room.  He went over to
the perpetrator's room, his own counter-prank in hand, went in, and turned
on the light.  When nothing happened, his reflexes again betrayed him: he
looked up at the light -- BLAM!

Apparently, the victim never bothered to counter-stack the perpetrator.

BTW.

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
