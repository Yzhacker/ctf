CTF Walkthrough Guide
1. Setup Instructions
Setup your virtual machine and network configuration.


2. Reconnaissance (Recon)
Perform Nmap scan to identify open ports and services.
Analyze the services running on the target machine.

netdiscover -r <10.10.10.0/24>

nmap -sV -v -Pn <10.10.10.7>
nmap -sC -A -p- -Pn <10.10.10.7>

Scan Results: 

Service Info:
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     pyftpdlib 1.5.5
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10 (protocol 2.0)


3. Enumeration
Enumerate services such as FTP, HTTP, SSH, etc.
Look for valuable files and potential weaknesses.

ftp 10.10.10.8 anonymous okay
ssh <>@10.10.10.8 need passward and user

4. Vulnerability Identification
Identify potential vulnerabilities based on the reconnaissance and enumeration.
Search for public exploits, misconfigurations, or weak service versions.

server has fpt anonymous user and has file with hashes of passwd
ftp 10.10.10.8 anonymous 
password no needed
ls backup 
get backup

***************
cat backup 
we can see users and hashes, now we can use john/hashcat to find password, but for dont take so longe I just pickup one, sunset

echo "conteÃºdo do arquivo/sunset-hashs" > novo_nome.txt
vin sunset/hashe

john <named file with hashes>
john --show <named file with hashes> case you alredy has brokend
now we have user an password of ssh
 

5. Exploitation
Exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to the system.
Use tools like Metasploit, Hydra, or custom scripts.

ssh sunset@10.10.10.6
sudo -l



6. Privilege Escalation
Attempt to escalate privileges from a limited user to root.
Explore file permissions, configuration files, and environment variables.

No need


7. Post-Exploitation
Maintain access, collect additional flags, or prepare for further exploitation.
Investigate further vulnerabilities and opportunities for additional access.



8. Flag Collection
Locate and capture flags (usually text files or output from certain commands).
Flag collection might be in different formats (e.g., flag.txt or output from a successful command).


9. Conclusion
Summarize your successful exploitation.
Review any lessons learned or tools/techniques that were effective
